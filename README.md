# CSC-113-Project-1

This is a simple script I wrote for my CSC 113 class. When the script is run, all .txt and .py files found in the 
script's current directory and subdirectories will be emailed to the specifed email address. All .txt and .py files 
will then have their extensions changed to .py, and contents changed to the script's content.
